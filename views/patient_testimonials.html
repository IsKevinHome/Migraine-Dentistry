                                            on. We left the club, went home and
                                            I went to bed. Ever since then, the

                                            telling me that all they could do
                                            was give me pain medication. Then I
                                            heard about Dr. Cohen. My husband
                                            didn’t think anything would work,
                                            but I really wanted to try
                                            neuromuscular dentistry. I am so
                                            glad that I did. My headaches have
                                            been reduced to about 1 every 6
                                            weeks, and even my husband, the
                                            skeptic, is amazed at the
                                            improvement. I am religious about
                                            wearing my orthotic and feel great.”

                            Nothing would stop the headaches; just control the
                            pain with drugs. It got to the point where I had to
                            carry narcotics with me everywhere I went.” Alan was
                            treated using neuromuscular dentistry and is now
                            virtually headache free. “I am so happy with the
                            results of my treatment. I am practically headache
                            free and don’t have to take any headache medications
                            anymore. What a relief after all these years.”

                            Barbara is a 37-year-old mom of three with a history
                            of headaches and stiff neck for the past 7 years.
                            She had seen numerous physicians, specialists,
                            chiropractors and acupuncturists over the years.
                            “Nobody was able to stop the headaches and I haven’t
                            been able to move my neck completely for 1 and ½
                            years. I had to miss my 10 year old’s birthday party
                            because of a migraine.” When Barbara came to our
                            office, she had a severe headache and a knot the
                            size of a golf ball in the muscles of her neck. We
                            used the TENS unit on her for 1 hr. “I couldn’t
                            believe it. My headache had disappeared, the knot in
                            my neck was gone, and I could move my neck from side
                            to side for the first time in a year and a half.”
                            Barbara has been virtually pain free for the last 3
                            months, and is extremely happy with the results of
                            her orthotic use. “I can’t wait to have my mouth
                            restored.”

                            Deaun had occasional migraines until two years ago.
                            ”I was at a comedy club with my husband and I felt a
                            migraine coming on. We left the club, went home and
                            I went to bed. Ever since then, the migraines have
                            been pretty much all the time for the last two
                            years.” Deaun had been to numerous doctors with no
                            resolution. “They kept telling me that all they
                            could do was give me pain medication. Then I heard
                            about Dr. Cohen. My husband didn’t think anything
                            would work, but I really wanted to try neuromuscular
                            dentistry. I am so glad that I did. My headaches
                            have been reduced to about 1 every 6 weeks, and even
                            my husband, the skeptic, is amazed at the
                            improvement. I am religious about wearing my
                            orthotic and feel great.”

                        <p>
                            TMJ (temporomandibular joint) problems manifest themselves in a variety of ways. One of the most common symptoms of TMJ are headaches. The most common type of headache is a
                            tension headache. Many people who suffer from this type of headache describe it as a ring of pain around the head. Others will refer to it as a migraine headache. TMJ
                            related headaches are caused by a complex mechanism. Essentially, there is a constant contraction of the muscles in the jaw. This creates a tension or pressure in the face,
                            head and neck. The constant tension in the muscles reduces the amount of blood that is able to reach the area. The body responds by sending more blood to the area, which
                            results in an increase in blood pressure to the muscles of the head, thus a headache. When someone is clenching and /or grinding their teeth, which are TMJ symptoms, they
                            are creating a constant contraction of the muscles, which results in pain. By putting the temporomandibular joint back into alignment and placing the jaw into its optimal
                            position, neuromuscular dentistry can alleviate most headache problems related to TMJ, muscle, nerve and joint disorder.

                        28 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, a type of headache that can often be debilitating. There are 3 times as many women sufferers as men. Although any type of
                        headache can be very uncomfortable, migraine headaches will often cause sufferers to be incapacitated. Sometimes people with migraines will experience some type of warning sign
                        know as an aura. These are usually such sensations as flashing lights, blind spots or tingling in the extremeties. In addition to the pain of a headache, migraine symptoms can
                        also include nausea, vomiting, and extreme sensitivity to sound and light. The only relief many sufferers can find is by locking themselves in a dark quiet room for hours or
                        even days. When left untreated, a typical migraine can last anywhere from 4 to 72 hours depending on the person. All of these symptoms are also symptoms of TMD, which can be
                        treated using Neuromuscular Dentistry.

                            There is a lot that is not understood about headaches. Some researchers believe that migraines may be the result of changes in the trigeminal nerve system, which is a major
                            pathway in the cranial nervous system. It is felt that changes in brain chemicals such as serotonin effect the pain messages running along this pathway. When a headache
                            occcurs, the level of serotonin in the brain drops. Scientists believe that this causes the trigeminal nerve to release a protein which travels to the brain's outer
                            covering. This protein causes the blood vessels of the outer covering to become dilated and inflamed. This results in a headache.

                        <p>
                            The type of migraine varies from person to person. Most people don't experience the aura before their headache. Those that do are experiencing what is known as a Classic
                            Migraine. Whether you experience an aura or not , many people have sensations or premonitions before the headache actually occurs. These symptoms may include: elation or
                            intense levels of energy, craving for sweets, drowsiness, irritability , depression or thirst.

                        <p class="lead">There are a number of things that may trigger a migraine:</p>
                        <h5>Hormonal changes.</h5>
                        <p>
                            The exact mechnism between headaches and hormones is not fully understood. Changes in estorgen and progesterone seem to cause migraine in a number of women. Women who have
                            a history of migraines report there occurence right before or after their periods. Those women who take contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy often report
                            migraines.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Foods.</h5>
                        <p>
                            Many people develop headaches after eating certain food. The most common food causes include: alcohol, especially red wine; aged cheeses; chocolate; fermented, pickled or
                            marinated foods; aspartame; caffeine; monosodium glutamates; certain seasonings; and many canned and processed foods.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Stress.</h5>
                        <p>Stress is often sighted as a major contributor to migraines. Whether it occurs at home or work, the body can react to stress with a headache.</p>
                        <h5>Sensory Stimulus</h5>
                        <p>
                            Bright or flashing lights and glaring sun can causes headache pain. Certain smells such as perfume and flowers, and unpleasant odors, such as paint thinner and cigerette
                            smoke.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Physical Factors</h5>
                        <p>Heavy manual work or exercise can set off a headache. Also, changes in sleep habits including too much or too little sleep can trigger a headache.</p>
                        <h5>Changes in the Environment</h5>
                        <p>
                            Changes in the weather, such as rain storms or changes in altiltude, such as going to the mountains, can result in a headache.A change of weather, season, altitude level,
                            barometric pressure or time zone can prompt a migraine headache.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Medications</h5>
                        <p>Certain medications can aggravate migraines.</p>

                        <p class="text-primary">
                            All of these factors can contribute to the occurence of a migraine headache. But the biggest factor is a poor bite relationship. When the upper and lower jaw are not
                            aligned properly, it results in the muscles being in a constant state of contraction. These muscles cause the jaws to come together 2000-3000 times every day during chewing
                            and swallowing. After a while, the muscles get tired and go into spasm. There is a build-up of lactic acid and other waste metabolites due to increased blood pressure in
                            the muscles, which prevents normal blood flow. This is the primary cause of migraines.

                            It used to be that if you had a headache, the doctor told you to "take two aspirin and call me in the morning." Today, numerous drugs have been designed to treat migraines.
                            These drugs are broken down into two categories. The strategy for preventing or relieving your headache will depend on how often they occur and how severe the headaches
                            are. Generally speaking, preventative therapy is used by those who have more than two migraines per month, or do not get relief form the normal pain-relieving headaches.

                            These are the usual over the counter medications, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) or aspirin. They may help with mild migraines. If taken often, these drugs can
                            lead to ulcers, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other problems.

                        <p>
                            Sumatriptan (Imitrex) was the first drug developed to treat migraines. Injected sumatriptan is the fasting working migraine medication available. There are a number of
                            similar drugs that have become available, including rizatriptan (Maxalt), naratriptan (Amerge), zolmitriptan (Zomig), almotriptan (Axert), frovatriptan (Frova) and
                            eletriptan (Relpax). The triptans have side effects which may include nausea, dizziness, and occassionally stroke or heart attack.

                            properties, but they have more serious side effects than the Triptans.

                            In addition to medications, the pain from muscle headaches can be reduced by cutting nerves with brain surgery or using biofeeback therapy. The problem with all of the
                            options mentioned is that we are treating the symptoms rather than the actual cause of the symptoms. By using neuromuscular dentistry, ensuring that the muscles are happy,
                            we remove the stress placed on the system. When the bite is correct, the migraines can disappear. Click here for more information on a
